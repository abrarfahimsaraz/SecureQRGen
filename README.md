# SecureQRGen 

**SecureQRGen** is a Python-based application that simplifies QR code creation while ensuring secure data transmission. This tool combines user-friendly graphical interfaces with robust encryption mechanisms, allowing users to generate and decrypt QR codes with enhanced data integrity and confidentiality.

## Features 🌟

- **🔒 Secure QR Code Generation:** Encodes user-provided messages into QR codes with encryption.
- **📷 QR Code Scanning and Decryption:** Extracts and decodes encrypted messages from QR codes.
- **🖥️ User-Friendly Interface:** A graphical interface built with PyQt5 for intuitive usage.
- **📁 Image Import and Export:** Supports loading images for QR code generation and saving QR codes as PNG files.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **🐍 Python** for backend logic and encryption.
- **🖌️ PyQt5** for the graphical user interface.
- **📦 qrcode** library for QR code generation.
- **📸 OpenCV** for QR code scanning and image processing.
- **🔐 Base64** for message encryption and decryption.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abrarfahimsaraz/SecureQRGen.git
   cd SecureQRGen
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note:** If the `requirements.txt` file is not provided, manually install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 qrcode opencv-python
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage ✨

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the **QR Code Generator** to input text, encrypt it, and generate a QR code.
3. Save the generated QR code as a PNG file for sharing or storage.
4. Use the **QR Code Scanner** to load a QR code image and retrieve the encrypted message.
